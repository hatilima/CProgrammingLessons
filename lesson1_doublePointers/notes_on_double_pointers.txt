Double pointers are used to change the value of a pointer in a function when you want to the new value to be persistent outside the function. That is, to change the address that is being pointed to by a pointer and maintain the change outside the function that is making the change.

void someChangingFunction(int** pp)
{
	//pp changed here and new value carried outside function
}
